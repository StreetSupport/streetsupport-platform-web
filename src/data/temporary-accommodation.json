    "description": "A safe place to call home is possibly the most critical thing which young people who are in crisis might need. We are here to help young people to develop resilience; this is much harder to do without the sense of security and support that a place to call home offers. If we can stop a young person from becoming homeless we will do everything that we can to do that. But when that hasn&rsquo;t worked we are committed to improving the range, quality and amount of accommodation that we can offer to young people.&#10;&#10;One of our most profound challenges is to support young people in very chaotic situations. There is an expectation that we can help them develop a sense of stability and independence in less than a year or eighteen months even when the situations which have brought about that sense of chaos may have persisted for years or even a lifetime.&#10;&#10;Our accommodation services promote choice and allow us to spend a longer period of time so we can support young people to successful independent living.",

    "description": "Every year YMCA Exeter provides Supported Accommodation for over 100 young people and helps many more find accommodation that is suitable to them.&#10;&#10;We have four stages of supported accommodation based across the city. These stages allow young people to have the level of support input that matches their needs. This can decrease or increase as needed. Moving from one stage of support to another doesn&#39;t necessarily mean moving accommodation.&#10;&#10;In general:&#10;&#10;* Stage 1 is based at our 31 bedroom residential centre in St David&rsquo;s Hill. Support is available on site almost lal teh time and each young person has a named worker for themselves. We have a huge amount of activities and groups they can get involved in across the week and access to trips away.&#10;&#10;* Stage 2 is generally based in larger shared houses (4 beds) where young people learn to live in smaller communities and sharing facilities. Accommodation rent levels are lower to enable people to work and still live affordably. Support is still based on site and there are regular groups and activities to get involved in.&#10;&#10;* Stage 3 is generally based in smaller shared houses (2 beds) or self contained accommodation. Rents are purposefully kept as low as possible (usually at or close to LHA rates) to enable young people to live affordably whilst working. Stage 3 houses are in close proximity to other Stage 3 houses and Young People are encouraged and empowered to take an active part in this community and provide neighbourly support to each other. Outreach workers arrange regular meet up and are always contactable as needed.&#10;&#10;Stage 4 is more usually in either self contained accommodation or larger shared houses where young people choose this more affordable way of living. Support is available as needed on request. Regular contact and social groups are organised and rents are kept low to enable young people to live affordably whilst working.&#10;&#10;Young People applying must be below 30 at the point of applying to the service. There is no requirement for those already in our services who turn 30 to move on due to their age.&#10;&#10;We can also accommodate 16-17-year-olds via a referral through Social Services.&#10;&#10;There isn&rsquo;t really a set time that young people can live at the YMCA, some stay with us for one year, others for several years as they move through our stages of accommodation before finding a permanent home of their own.&#10;&#10;Our accommodation is specifically for young people who are coming out of homelessness and would like the support of a caring community to move forward. Some of our residents have been sleeping rough, some have been asked to leave their current home situation (or be threatened with this) and others may have been sofa surfing or living in a tent or car. &#10;&#10;YMCA Exeter isn&rsquo;t just a place to stay though. Our Link Workers support residents during their stay at YMCA so they can develop their own potential in body, mind and spirit.",

    "description": "Sussex Nightstop is a Brighton &amp; Hove homeless charity that prevents rough-sleeping by setting up short stays in the homes of volunteer hosts who have a spare room to offer. We are one of over 30 accredited Nightstop services in operation across the UK; offering free, short-stay, emergency accommodation in warm, welcoming, family homes.&#10;&#10;Our Nightstop guests are either at risk of rough-sleeping, have had a short experience of rough-sleeping or find themselves needing to use other potentially unsafe sleeping arrangements, such as sofa-surfing. At a point of crisis and vulnerability, guests are often trying to maintain positive investments in their life such as work, study or training.  &#10;&#10;Nightstop works with people who have a low or medium level and who otherwise meet our service thresholds. We focus our efforts where we think we can make the most difference with the resource we have available. Currently, we are working with young people age 16-25 years only.&#10;&#10;The negative effects of rough-sleeping and sofa-surfing are profound. By providing safe accommodation at the earliest point, our Nightstop service provides people with the best opportunity to work on their housing plan. Working together with our local housing advice partners, our goal is that Nightstop guests move from our service into a safe, longer-term place they can call home.&#10;&#10;Our volunteer host households are based in Brighton &amp; Hove and outlying areas in Sussex that are easily accessible by a short journey on public transport. They are recruited, screened, trained and supported by us to carry out their role in a safe and effective way. Our hosts provide a safe private room, a hot meal, access to washing facilities and a listening ear if needed. Our service provides a very practical way that people can volunteer in support of reducing homelessness.&#10;&#10;Accessing our service is through our approved referral agencies only. These are currently YMCA DLG Housing Advice and Brighton &amp; Hove City Council Children&rsquo;s Services.  We don&rsquo;t accept self-referrals, but we welcome enquiries about our service.",

This has places for seven residents and is staffed at all times. Cromwell Road offers detoxification support to residents who need it, in partnership with drug and alcohol support services in Brighton and Hove. Some residents do not require detoxification but remain at Cromwell Road in order to stabilise and become accustomed to the structure of residential treatment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Residents are often at various stages of the detoxification and recovery process, and join the CBT-based group-work programme as well as engaging with one-to-one support. Residents are supported to reflect on and address the reasons behind their drug and alcohol use, as well as engaging with other recovery activities including creative groups, gardening and literacy support. Residents stay at Cromwell Road for around 3 months, although this is dependent on their need and progress against their support plans.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;STAGE 2&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second stage is based at Arch House in Hove, where up to 8 residents participate in workshops and completing assignments focussing on relapse prevention, anger management, and social interaction and integration skills. Services users at Arch House are moving towards a greater degree of independence, and as such Arch is staffed during office hours. Residents can access support from Cromwell Road staff team if needed 24/7.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Residents are encouraged to engage with volunteering, peer mentoring, training and education opportunities as part of the programme of recovery, explored alongside move-on accommodation options. Typically service users remain at Arch House for 4 to 6 months. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;STAGE 3&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The third stage is based at &amp;lsquo;Star House&amp;rsquo; in Portslade: this is the St Thomas Fund &amp;lsquo;move-on house&amp;rsquo;. This third stage supports residents to become fully prepared for independent living and re-engagement with the community.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Service users here have largely finished the main recovery programme, and are in full time voluntary work and/or part time employment. Residents can remain here for up to two years, dependent on their needs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The service aims to reduce:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;* The levels of substance misuse and harm caused by * &amp;#10;* Drugs and alcohol&amp;#10;* Offending behaviour&amp;#10;* Anti-social behaviour&amp;#10;* Numbers of people rough sleeping&amp;#10;* Drug and alcohol related deaths&amp;#10;* Drug and alcohol related domestic violence with both perpetrators and survivors&amp;#10;&amp;#10;and increase:&amp;#10;* Referrals into work and training placements&amp;#10;* The numbers of people living in stable accommodation and entering employment, education and training"

We offer different types of accommodation for young people, from high support 24-hour staffed projects to flats in the community to supported lodgings with a host family. Our work is about breaking the cycles of homelessness and helping young people work through the behaviours that prevent them moving on and finding stable accommodation. &#10;We do not label our young people as &quot;homeless&quot; - they are individual, charismatic and full of potential. Their situation is not what defines them. &#10;Our team encourages engagement through enjoyable activities; we run cooking groups, art sessions, drop- ins and work shops. We also offer support sessions which allow young people to set realistic goals. We support young people to attend appointments, help them to enrol at college, or support them with a food shop.&#10;We have an employment, education training and volunteer coordinator, to support the young people we work with. Young people have started plastering, playing football and online IT courses &amp; many other exciting opportunities.",

They will learn tenancy management skills, general life skills, employment skills, personal resilience and crisis management. We also help tenants to access suitable training and employment, and support them to go on to find a suitable home to move on to.&#10;&#10;Facilities:&#10;&#10;* The accommodation comprises of five 2x bedroom flats. &#10;* Each flat has a shared kitchen, bathroom and living room. &#10;* The rooms will be furnished and white goods/ cooking utensils will be provided. &#10;* The project will accommodate 10 x residents in 5x 2 bedroom flats.&#10;* Residents will share with one other tenant.

We also have a quiet room that can be used to access the computer or to watch a DVD if you wish.&#10;&#10;There is a garden at the rear which is used for communal barbeques in the summer, gardening activities and as somewhere to enjoy the sun!&#10;&#10;There is a communal kitchen for you to prepare food and we also run cookery classes and occasional group meals which is a great way for you all to get to know each other and enjoy a sense of community.&#10;&#10;During your stay at Esther, you will be assigned a Keyworker who will work with you to identify the areas that you may need support with. Their aim is to equip you with the necessary skills to move on and to address any difficulties you may be having that you wish to have support with.&#10;&#10;Our Structured Day Plan allows those staying at the project to engage with activities. These activities can range from educational courses such as literacy or numeracy to group activities where those living at the project can be creative or learn new skills. Part of the aim of the Structured Day Plan is to build confidence in those individuals who often feel marginalised as a result of their experiences.  Young people staying at the project are able to become a part of this planning by suggesting what activities may appeal to them or what skills they may wish to learn or improve.&#10;&#10;The Structured Day Plan also offers residents a chance to get together and feel a real sense of belonging to a community. We have been able to offer such activities as mosaic making, group cooking and card making. Many residents have remarked how much they have not only enjoyed the activity but also enjoyed the sense of community that this has brought to the house",
